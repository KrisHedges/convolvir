## Gemini Added Memories

*   This project uses Next.js version 16 (canary). I must prioritize and refer to the documentation and conventions for this specific version, not the stable releases.
*   This project uses `proxy.ts` as the middleware file, following the Next.js 16 convention, instead of `middleware.ts`.
*   The user prefers vanilla CSS for styling and has actively removed all Tailwind CSS and related UI libraries (`shadcn/ui`, `lucide-react`, etc.).
*   The user prefers to remove unused or unwanted components and directories entirely rather than leaving them in the codebase.
